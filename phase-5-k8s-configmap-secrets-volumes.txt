Kubernetes ConfigMaps + Secrets + Volume Mounts
This phase will introduce managing application configuration and sensitive data in Kubernetes along with persistent storage.

ðŸ”¸ Goals:
    1. Use ConfigMap to inject application configs (e.g., Spring Boot application.properties).
    2. Use Secrets to securely pass credentials (e.g., DB password).
    3. Mount a Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
    4. Reference these in your deployment YAML.
    5. Re-deploy the app using Jenkins + Minikube
